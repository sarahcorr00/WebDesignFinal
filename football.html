        <p id="mainText"> Gaelic Football is a distinctly Irish field invasion game played with a round football which can be caught, kicked and hand passed.</p>

        <h1>Equipment</h1>

        <p>The ball used in Gaelic Football is round, slightly smaller than a soccer ball.</p>

        <h1>Playing Rules</h1>

        <p>The ball can be carried in the hand for a distance of four steps and can be kicked or "hand-passed", a striking motion with the hand or fist. After every four steps the ball must be either bounced or "solo-ed", an action of dropping the ball onto the foot and kicking it back into the hand. You may not bounce the ball twice in a row. Players may contest for the ball by playing it with the hand or by shoulder charging an opponent side-to-side.</p>

        <h1>Scoring</h1>

        <p>To score, you put the ball over the crossbar by foot or fist for one point or under the crossbar and into the net by foot or the hand / fist in certain circumstances for a goal, the latter being the equivalent of three points. 

        A goal is signalled by raising a green flag, placed to the left of the goal. A point is signalled by raising a white flag, placed to the right of goal.</p>

        <h1>Officiating</h1>

        <p>Officials for a game comprise of a referee, two linesmen (to indicate when the ball leaves the field of play at the side and to mark '45â€™ free kicks and four umpires (to signal scores, assist the referee in controlling the games, and to assist linesmen in positioning '45' frees). </p>
